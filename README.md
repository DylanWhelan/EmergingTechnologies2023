# Emerging Technologies Repository - Dylan Whelan - G00381563

This is a respository containing my work for the emerging technologies module, for my final year in ATU software development

### Notebooks
There are two notebooks in the contents folder a Computations notebook and a HTTP notebook 
The Computations notebook contains information regarding rates of growth and plots displaying examples, some text on the Turing machine and a little on logic circuits
The HTTP notebook contains some information on the HTTP, including a bit on requests and responses as well as a definition as to what a server is

### How to open the notebooks

The notebooks can be opened using the repositories JupyterLite instance located at this Github pages webpage: https://dylanwhelan.github.io/EmergingTechnologies2023/

The jupyerLyte instance is rebuilt as github action, whenever a commit is made to the main branch, this ensure that it has the most up to date copies of notebooks
