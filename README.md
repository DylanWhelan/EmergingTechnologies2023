# Emerging Technologies Repository - Dylan Whelan - G00381563

This is a respository containing my work for the emerging technologies module, for my final year in ATU software development

### Notebook
In the contents folder is a jupyter notebook on computations, containing information regarding the Turing machine, and plots regarding rates of growth

### How to open the notebook

My JupyterLyte instance can be found here, and the repository's notebook can be found in the contents folder: https://dylanwhelan.github.io/EmergingTechnologies2023/

The jupyerLyte instance is rebuilt as github action, whenever a commit is made to the main branch, this ensure that it has the most up to date copies of notebooks
